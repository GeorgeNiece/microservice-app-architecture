## Securing a Kubernetes Ingress Using TLS

------

**NOTE:** For this lab it's easiest to use `Minikube` because it provides a simple ingress controller.

[Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) are the instructions for installing Minikube on your local machine.

Or, you can use the  Katacoda Playground for Minikube found [here](https://katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/kubectl-run-containers).

------

We're going to implement TLS on Minikube with the ingress controller enabled.

**Step 1:** Enable the ingress controller on Minikube. Assuming you have Minikube installed. At the command line, type

`minikube addons enable ingress`

**Step 2:** Create an `nginx` deployment. At the command line, type

`kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`

**Step 3:** Bind the service. At the command line, type

`kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80`

**Step 4:** Create the unsecured ingress. At the command line, type

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`

Create an entry into the file `/etc/hosts` so that `example.com` when called on the local machine will
resolve to the IP address of minikube.

**Step 5:** Execute the following command to make the entry to `/etc/hosts`.

`echo "$(minikube ip) example.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

**Step 6:** Make a call using `curl` to ensure the service is running

`curl http://example.com`

**Step 7:** Now it's time to make the self signed TLS certificate. Execute the following command:

`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=example.com" -days 365`

**WHERE**

`-keyout tls.key` is the name of the private key

`-out tls.crt` is the name of the public certificate passed in by a calling client requesting access

`-subj "/CN=example.com"` indicates the credentials apply to the domain, `example.com`

`-days 365` sets the credentials to be valid for 365 days

**Step 8:** Create the Kubernetes secret that will hold the private key and public certificate. We'll do
this imperatively. So execute the following command.

`kubectl create secret tls example-com-tls --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key`

**Step 9:**: Update the ingress to include the certificate information and binding to `example.com`.

`kubectl apply -f update-ingress.yaml`

**Step 10:**: Try to access the nginx server using `curl` as you did before. You'll fail.

`curl http://example.com`

**Step 11:**: Make a `curl` call with the certificate.

`curl --cacert tls.crt https://example.com`

## Clean Up

Delete the deployment

`kubectl delete deployment nginx`

Delete the service

`kubectl delete service nginx`

Delete ingress

`kubectl delete ingress nginx`

Delete the secret

`kubectl delete secret example-com-tls`

## Manifests

ingress.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            serviceName: nginx
```

update-ingress.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  tls:
    - secretName: example-com-tls
      hosts:
        - example.com
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            serviceName: nginx
            servicePort: 80

```
